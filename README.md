# Multiplayer Snake Game Server

This is the server leaderboard app of my multiplayer snake game which can be found here: https://github.com/IlhamIbrahimli/multiplayerSnakeGame

## To run server
Run main.py and input number of players. Note: The game will only begin once the player count has been reached.

After inputting player count a white pygame box will appear and will not be responding.
This is normal behaviour as it is waiting for all of the players to join the game.

## For game organisers
Please tell players not to close the game window or stop the program after they lost as this will crash the server. This bug will be fixed in a future update.
Server app contains a simple unsorted leaderboard.
